# Bot Blocker - Honeypot and Time Delay Techniques

This project demonstrates a simple PHP-based bot-blocking mechanism using Honeypot and Time Delay techniques.

## Features

- **Honeypot**: Hidden form fields that bots are likely to fill out, but human users will not see.
- **Time Delay**: Tracks the time between page load and form submission. Submissions made too quickly are likely from bots.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bot-blocker.git
*```
