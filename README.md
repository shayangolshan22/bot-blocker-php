# bot-blocker-php
 This project implements a simple honeypot technique to prevent bots and automated scripts from downloading videos. It uses PHP to create hidden fields or elements that bots might interact with but human users will not see, thus detecting and blocking unwanted access. Ideal for protecting media content from unauthorized downloads.
